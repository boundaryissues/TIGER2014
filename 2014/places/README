Files in this directory are derived from TIGER 2014 places shapefiles.
At the present time two stages of processing have been applied. The first
stage separates the entities inside of the places shape files by the
LSAD ("Legal and Statistical Area Definition") code into a separate file
by LSAD. The reault may be find in the zip files; the LSAD value is appended
to the original places file name.

The second stage is a straightline conversion from shapefile to geojson. At
the present time the TIGER attributes are preserved.

Current plans are to provide a second version of the geojson formatted files
with TIGER Attributes replaced by OSM admin_boundary tags.

The spreadsheet TIGER-LSAD-code-summary.ods in the directory immediately above
this one contains a breakdown of the LSAD codes which appear in places and
county subdivision shapefiles. This spreadsheet is still subject to change.
