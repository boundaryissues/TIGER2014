Files in this directory are derived from TIGER 2014 county subdivision
shapefiles. At the present time two stages of processing have been applied.
The first stage separates the entities inside of the shapefiles by the
LSAD ("Legal and Statistical Area Definition") code into separate shapefiles
by LSAD. The result may be found in the zip files; the LSAD value is appended
to the original places file name.

The second stage is a direct conversion from the individual LSAD-divided
shapefiles to geojson. At the present time the TIGER attributes are preserved.

Current plans are to provide a second version of the geojson formatted files
with TIGER Attributes replaced by OSM admin_boundary tags.

The spreadsheet TIGER-LSAD-code-summary.ods in the directory immediately above
this one contains a breakdown of the LSAD codes which appear in places and
county subdivision shapefiles. This spreadsheet is still subject to change.
