The Georgia state place file uses the following LSAD codes:

UG  Unified Government (City & County) - Legal boundary
00  Athens, Macon & Augusta - Legal boundary
25  City - Legal boundary
43  Town - Legal boundary
57  CDP (Census Designated Place) - Statistical Boundary

the boundaries for Athens & Augusta in consolidated/GA may be more useful
than the boundaries for those communities in the UG and 00 files here.
